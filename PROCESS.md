Today I started with a world map that I initialized yesterday with the help of [Datamaps](http://datamaps.github.io/):

I had some difficulties with getting a European map instead of just the world or USA. I used code from [Datamaps](http://datamaps.github.io/) and trial and error to zoom in on Europe:

Then, I made the radar chart using an [example](https://gist.github.com/nbremer/6506614):

Difficulties that I encounter are that my values are not given as percentages, so I transformed my data. The axes still need to be converted and the country codes need to be added to the data to allow for interactivity.
