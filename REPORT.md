## The application
My application is depicted below. Four charts allow for an insight into the performance on three different environmental variables (waste, energy and emission) of the countries in the EU:

* **Map**: The colors give an indication on the environmental friendliness based on a self-created index. The map is linked to the radar chart and the stacked graph
* **Circle menu**: The heigth of the waves give an indication of the relative performance of the selected country on the variable belonging to that circle. The circles are linked to the stacked graph.
* **Radar chart**: The radar chart allows for relative comparison of the selected countries: The axes show the performance compared to the maximum value of the variable. The radar chart is linked to the map.
* **Stacked graph**: The layers of the graph show the composition of one of the variables waste, energy and emission. Exact values are shown on hover. The legend and y-axis update according to the selected country from the map and the circle menu. The stacked graph is linked to the map and the circle menu.
